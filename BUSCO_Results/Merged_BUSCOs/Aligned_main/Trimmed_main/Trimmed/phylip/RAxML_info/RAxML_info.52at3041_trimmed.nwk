IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 124 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file 52at3041_trimmed.phy.reduced

Alignment has 124 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
